GettingCleaningData
===================

Peer Assignment for Getting &amp; Cleaning Data

There is only one R file which has to be executed to get the required output.
Please follow the steps given below to perform the analysis:-

1) Open "run_analysis.R" in RStudio.

2) In the code on line 4, the variable "wPath". This variable must contain the path to the
   folder which contains "UCI HAR Dataset".
   Please change the path accordingly.

3) Also note, that as the OS on which this code was written was is Windows 8.1, the code is 
   written to work in the same OS. To use in another OS, the only difference would be in the 
   variable "delimiter". Please change the delimiter to suit your OS.

4) Once these changes are completed, simply type source("run_analysis.R") in RStudio. This 
   will automatically start the execution of the code within.

5) The code was written with the assumption that there is no change made to the contents of
   UCI HAR Dataset.

Please refer to CodeBook.md for a complete list of variables, and the process followed in "run_analysis.R".
